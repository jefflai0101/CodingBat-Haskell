--We have bunnies standing in a line, numbered 1, 2, ... The odd bunnies (1, 3, ..) have the normal 2 ears.
--The even bunnies (2, 4, ..) we'll say have 3 ears, because they each have a raised foot.
--Recursively return the number of "ears" in the bunny line 1, 2, ... n (without loops or multiplication).
